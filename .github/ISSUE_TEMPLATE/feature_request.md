<!--
When trying to solve more solutions with Normalizr, please keep in mind some of the following goals of the package:
* Be lightweight: small package size (single-digit KiBs, gzipped)
* Be easy: too many options in an API can become confusing
* Be clear: the intended purpose of every method should be as obvious as possible
* Is it easy to do this in "userland"? Would it be better off done there?
-->

# Problem

Explain the problem you'd like to have Normalizr handle.

# Solution

Explain a possible way to solve the problem. Keep in mind that there may be alternate ways to do the same thing. Try to think of those and weight the tradeoffs.
